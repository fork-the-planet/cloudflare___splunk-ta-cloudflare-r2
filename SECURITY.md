## Known security considerations

### Credential storage

The R2 secret access key is never written to `inputs.conf`. At configuration
time the add-on stores it in Splunk's encrypted credential store
(`storage/passwords`) via solnlib's `conf_manager`, and the modular input reads
it back from there at run time. No plaintext credential is written to the
add-on's conf files or the app-local filesystem.

### R2 API token scope

When generating R2 API tokens for use with this add-on, scope them to:
- **Permission**: Object Read only (not Read & Write)
- **Bucket**: Specific bucket (not all buckets)

This limits the blast radius if credentials are ever exposed.

### TLS verification

The `verify_ssl` parameter defaults to `true`. Only set it to `false` if your
network performs TLS inspection on outbound traffic and you have confirmed the
inspection CA is from your own organization. Disabling SSL verification exposes
the connection to man-in-the-middle attacks.
